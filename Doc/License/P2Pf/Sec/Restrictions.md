Ti=Restrictions

0.sec=The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: 

1.sec={You} may {Distribute} or {Publicly_Perform} the {Work} only under the terms of this {License}. {You} must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this {License} with every copy of the {Work} {You} {Distribute} or {Publicly_Perform}. {You} may not offer or impose any terms on the {Work} that restrict the terms of this {License} or the ability of the recipient of the {Work} to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the {License}. {You} may not sublicense the {Work}. {You} must keep intact all notices that refer to this {License} and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the {Work} {You} {Distribute} or {Publicly_Perform}. When {You} {Distribute} or {Publicly_Perform} the {Work}, {You} may not impose any effective technological measures on the {Work} that restrict the ability of a recipient of the {Work} from {You} to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the {License}. This Section 4(a) applies to the {Work} as incorporated in a {Collection}, but this does not require the {Collection} apart from the {Work} itself to be made subject to the terms of this {License}. If {You} create a {Collection}, upon notice from any {Licensor} {You} must, to the extent practicable, remove from the {Collection} any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If {You} create an {Adaptation}, upon notice from any Licensor {You} must, to the extent practicable, remove from the {Adaptation} any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested. 

2.sec=Subject to the exception in Section 4(c), you may not exercise any of the rights granted to {You} in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed to ward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the {Work} for other copyrighted works by means of digital filesharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works. 

3.0.sec=<b>{You} may exercise the rights granted in Section 3 for commercial purposes only if:</b> 

3.1.sec=<b>{You} are a workerowned business or workerowned collective; and'</b>
 
3.2.sec=<b>all financial gain, surplus, profits and benefits produced by the business or collective are distributed among the workerowners</b>

3.=[Z/Sec/s2]

4.sec=Any use by a business that is privately owned and managed, and that seeks to generate profit from the labor of employees paid by salary or other wages, is not permitted under this {License}. 

5.sec=If {You} {Distribute}, or {Publicly_Perform} the {Work} or any {Adaptations} or {Collections}, {You} must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copy right notices for the {Work} and provide, reasonable to the medium or means {You} are utilizing: (i) the name of the {Original_Author} (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the {Original_Author} and/or {Licensor} designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (“{Attribution_Parties}”) in {Licensor}’s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the {Work} if supplied; (iii) to the extent reason ably practicable, the URI, if any, that {Licensor} specifies to be associated with the {Work}, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the {Work}; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an {Adaptation}, a credit identifying the use of the {Work} in the {Adaptation} (e.g., “French translation of the {Work} by {Original_Author},” or “Screenplay based on original {Work} by {Original_Author}”). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a {Adaptation} or {Collection}, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the {Adaptation} or {Collection} appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, {You} may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising {Your} rights under this {License}, {You} may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the {Original_Author}, {Licensor} and/or {Attribution_Parties}, as appropriate, of {You} or {Your} use of the {Work}, without the separate, express prior written permission of the {Original_Author}, {Licensor} and/or {Attribution_Parties}. 

6.0.sec=For the avoidance of doubt: 

6.1.Ti=Nonwaivable Compulsory License Schemes

6.1.sec=In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can not be waived, the {Licensor} reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by {You} of the rights granted under this {License}; 

6.2.Ti=Waivable Compulsory License Schemes

6.2.sec=In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the {Licensor} reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by {You} of the rights granted under this {License} if {Your} exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and, 

6.3.Ti=Voluntary License Schemes

6.3.sec=The {Licensor} reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the {Licensor} is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by {You} of the rights granted under this {License} that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b).
6.=[Z/Sec/3]

7.sec=Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the {Licensor} or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if {You} {Reproduce}, {Distribute} or {Publicly_Perform} the {Work} either by itself or as part of any {Adaptations} or {Collections}, {You} must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the {Work} which would be prejudicial to the {Original_Author}’s honor or reputation. {Licensor} agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this {License} (the right to make {Adaptations}) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the {Original_Author}’s honor and reputation, the {Licensor} will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable {You} to reasonably exercise {Your} right under Section 3(b) of this {License} (right to make {Adaptations}) but not otherwise.
