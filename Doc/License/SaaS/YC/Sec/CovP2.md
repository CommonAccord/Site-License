1.sec=Customer will not, directly or indirectly: reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover the source code, object code or underlying structure, ideas, know-how or algorithms relevant to the Services or any software, documentation or data related to the Services ("Software"); modify, translate, or create derivative works based on the Services or any Software (except to the extent expressly permitted by Company or authorized within the Services); use the Services or any Software for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise for the benefit of a third; or remove any proprietary notices or labels.  With respect to any Software that is distributed or provided to Customer for use on Customer premises or devices, Company hereby grants Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use such Software during the Term only in connection with the Services.

/Note=OPTIONAL: if there is no distributed software, this clause can be deleted. (this means above)

As defined in FAR section 2.101, the Software and documentation are "commercial items" and according to DFAR section 252.227 7014(a)(1) and (5) are deemed to be "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation."  Consistent with DFAR section 227.7202 and FAR section 12.212, any use modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such commercial software or commercial software documentation by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by the terms of this Agreement and will be prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

Note=export and government rights clauses are typically less important for pure hosted solutions, but there are still some potential triggers with certain kinds of technical information (and if there is any client-side code).

Note=many larger customers resist these types of indemnity clauses.  The decision on whether or not to include this clause may depend on the type of solution and potential commercial risk actually posed by Customer's usage.

3.3.sec=Although Company has no obligation to monitor Customer's use of the Services, Company may do so and may prohibit any use of the Services it believes may be (or alleged to be) in violation of the foregoing.
