EntityType=Limited Partnership (L.P.) and Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)  

0.1.sec=The LP and LLP are similar to a general partnership in that is two or more individuals or entities coming together to conduct a business.

0.2.sec=However, the key difference is that some or all of the partners have limited liability—meaning they can only lose the amount they have invested in the business.

0.3.sec=In an LP, there is one general partner who manages the business on day-to-day basis and like a sole proprietor has unlimited liability for the debts and liabilities of the partnership.

0.4.sec=In an LLP, none of the partners are responsible for another partner’s debts, obligations, or liabilities including those resulting from malpractice or misconduct.

0.5.sec=LLPs are usually limited by state law to professional associations—lawyers, architects, doctors, etc.

Plus.1.Ti=Limited liability

Plus.1.sec=As discussed above.

Plus.2.Ti=Open to outside investors

Plus.2.sec=This type of entity is more capable of attracting investment because passive investors are only liable up the amount they put in the business.

Plus.3.Ti=No double taxation

Plus.3.sec=Pass through entity for taxation.

Minus.1.Ti=More complicated

Minus.1.sec=Typically a general partner is an entity that already shields individuals from unlimited liability, for example the general partner in an LP is often a Corporation or LLC which makes the overall structure more complicated and expensive.

Minus.2.Ti=More expensive for initial set-up, especially in New York

Minus.2.1.sec=Typically an LP or LLP must register with the state.

Minus.2.2.sec=An written and executed partnership agreement should be drafted and executed.

Minus.2.3.sec=In addition, New York makes it expensive to set up an LP, LLP, or LLC by being one of the only states that require limited liability entities (LPs, LLPs, and LLCs) to file a “notice of publication” in two daily papers for 6 weeks.

Minus.2.4.sec=This can cost an additional $600 to $1500 depending on which county the entity is situated.

Minus.2.5.sec=The information found in this notice of publication, can also be found for free on the NY Secretary of State website, and essentially this requirement basically exists to provide a nice fat subsidy to a select few media companies, as the 46 other states in the United States have eliminated the Notice of Publication requirement.

Minus.2.=[Z/para/s5]

Minus.3.Ti=Limited Management

Minus.3.1.sec=In a L.P. limited partners may not participate in management of the firm, otherwise they will be held to the liability of a general partner.

Minus.3.2.sec=L.L.P. is different, in that limited partners may participate in management.
