Ti=CONCEPTUALISATION OF RIGHTS AND META-RULE OF LAW FOR THE WEB OF DATA

Author=Pompeu Casanovas

Summary=This article deals with some regulatory and legal problems of the Web of Data. Data and metadata are defined. Digital Rights Management (DRM) and Rights Expression Languages (REL) are introduced. Open Digital Rights Language (ODR) and Licensed Linked Data Resources (LLDR) are referred. The development of REL by means of Ontology Design Patterns such as LLDR, or Open Licenses sustained by Policy Models such as ODRL, situates the discussion on metadata at the regulatory level. With the development of the Web of Data the Rule of Law needs to evolve to a Meta-Rule of Law, incorporating tools to regulate and monitor the semantic layer of the Web. This means reflecting on the construction of a new public dimension space for the exercise of rights.
