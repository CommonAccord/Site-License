Ti=Alternative Sections

Alt1.Ti=Base

Alt1.sec=If there are a number of alternative clauses that you want to present together, list them like you would sections in a document, but with "Alt" before the section number. Then organize them as a section, but instead of using Z/Sec/X (where X is the number of sections) you use Z/Alt/X. Then prompt the user with <br>{Alt0.sec} <br> The prefixes you expect or suggest to be used in referring to the section (e.g. SecName=Misc.Entire). 

Alt2.Ti=What you get

Alt2.sec=These /Alt/ components add a slight overlay to the basic /Sec/ components - coloring in red and providing an intro that prompts the user to make a choice. (Obviously, this can be improved with further interface, but it is useful to be independent of the software, since it is easy to customize, share and audit.

Alt3.Ti=How it is used

Alt3.sec=The clauses can be used exactly the same as Sec or sec sections. And the prompts are appropriate.  The user can copy and paste a bit of the instruction into their document in the format Misc.Entire.Sec={Misc.Entire.Alt3.Sec}.  The choice is made, the color drops out.

Alt4.Ti=Dog Food

Alt4.sec=Note that these sections are not alternatives, but we use the format so you can see.
