Goal=Let's create a solution of legal documents for startups.  We'll do this by making a list of useful documents, putting some models up, systematizing them, forking for different use cases.  Critical to this is (dixit @mdangear) feedback and use by startups, incubators and the legal community.

Note=Borrowing from the list from <a href="http://www.docracy.com/topic/0ayx3g5yeq2/funding-documents-for-startups?startPdfDownload=false">Docracy</a>
